#
# Naming standard for error codes
# Keys are `error.<ERROR_CODE>`, where `<ERROR_CODE>` is the name of the ErrorCode value used.
#
# Note that two single quotes are required for a single quote to appear ONLY IF the message has arguments.
# In other words, `Message with arg ''{0}''` (with argument "zero" passed) will appear as `Message with arg 'zero'`,
# while `Message without 'arg'` will appear as `Message without 'arg'`.
#
